It introduces key analysis tools of customer level data such as clustering methods for segmentation, choice models using both stated preference data (survey/conjoint data) and behavioral data (scanner panel data, attribution data) and marketing mix models. The class uses real-world cases, exercises and projects to help aggregate the theories, frameworks and methods. In addition, the class aims to add to introduce sophisticated ideas and approaches to analyzing, interpreting and portraying customer and marketing data.
